					Transit Parcels and Logistics Company Ltd started in 2017 with two
					individuals and one motorcycle. Going through hurdles, one after the
					other, nearly giving up but moving on steadily. Now, the company has
					seen a gradual growth in the industry with a sizeable fleet with plans
					for expansion. Our belief in loyal relationships has helped us
					establish partnerships with Zen Logistics and Wash and Go have been
					established. Transit parcels began as a vision inspired by God and as
					a result of that and loyal employees, there has been major growth and
					improvement in the industry.
